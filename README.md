# Word Tic-Tac-Toe & Pyramid Tic-Tac-Toe

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains two variations of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game:
1. **Word Tic-Tac-Toe**: Instead of using 'X' and 'O', players use words of the same length.
2. **Pyramid Tic-Tac-Toe**: A unique twist where the board is shaped like a pyramid, adding complexity to the game strategy.

## 🛠 Features
- Two different game modes with distinct rules.
- Interactive command-line interface.
- Custom word-based gameplay in Word Tic-Tac-Toe.
- Pyramid-based board layout in Pyramid Tic-Tac-Toe.
